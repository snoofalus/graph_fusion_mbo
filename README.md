# Graph Fusion MBO
The code of this repository is an unofficial extension of [A Graph-Based Approach for Data Fusion andSegmentation of Multimodal Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206144).

Its goal is semantic segmentation of multimodal images by:
1. Constructing weighted graphs for each input modality
2. Fusing weighted graphs into a similarity matrix W
3. Approximating the l largest eigenvectors of the of the graph laplacian L = I - D^(-1/2)WD^(1/2) through Nystr√∂m
4. Running classification on the eigenvectors through an iterative semi-supervised MBO scheme or Spectral Clustering
